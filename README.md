# VibeCleaner ðŸ§¹

A no-nonsense Xcode Source Editor Extension to clean up the mess left by your AI coding assistant.

## What is this?

Ever asked an AI for a quick code snippet and received a novel of useless comments and debugging `print()` statements? We've all been there.

This extension is the digital mop you didn't know you needed. It integrates directly into Xcode's "Editor" menu and allows you to instantly wipe your active source file clean of AI-generated junk, helping you take back control of your codebase.

```js 
It's not removing // MARK: This mark comments
```

### Features

This extension provides two simple but powerful commands:

*   **Clean Comments**: Nukes all `// ...` and `/* ... */` comments from the file. It's smart enough to leave your precious `// MARK:` directives untouched, so your code organization remains intact.
*   **Clean Prints**: Eradicates every last `print()` statement, ensuring your console stays clean on release builds.
